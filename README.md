# fruitr

An [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package evolving with the needs and desires of [Falling Fruit](https://github.com/falling-fruit). Functionality currently focuses on [location import](vignettes/imports.Rmd), fast [location clustering](vignettes/clusters.Rmd), and common name translations.

The package is not on CRAN. To install in R, use [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools):

```R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("falling-fruit/fruitr")
```
